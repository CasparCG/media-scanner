# CasparCG Code of Conduct

> CasparCG is all about showing respect and professionalism one to another.

## Community

We want a positive and inspiring community that welcomes and embraces new ideas with respect and professionalism. CasparCG community has arisen through hard work and tremendous enthusiasm of hundreds of people around the world.

This Code of Conduct is about how we behave, act and cooperate in this positive and inspiring community. Contributors and users who engage in the CasparCG project in one way or another share this Code of Conduct.

## We strive to:

### Be considerate
CasparCG is used by other people and in various environments such as production. Your actions will affect other community members and therefore we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions.

### Be respectful
In a community there will always be some form of disagreement, but that is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Treat one another with respect and professionalism to make community members feel comfortable. We work together, as a union, to resolve conflicts and to maintain the positive and inspiring atmosphere in our community.

We do not tolerate personal attacks, racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination or abuses. Maintainers of the project have right to suspend the person who persistently breaks to our Code of Conduct.

### Be collaborative
Collaboration helps to reduce redundancy while improving the quality of the project and the software produced. To avoid misunderstanding, try to be clear when requesting for help, giving help or asking for feedback. If something is unclear ask for clarification.

### Be supportive
CasparCG community is made up by mutual respect, collaboration and professional behavior. If you witness others being discriminated or abused, think about how you can be supportive. If the identified situation is beyond your ability, ask the victim privately if some form of official intervention is needed to solve the uncomfortable situation.

### Ask for help
By asking questions early we can avoid many problems that can arise later on. We encourage you to ask questions. Those who are asked should be helpful and answer with professionalism in mind.
